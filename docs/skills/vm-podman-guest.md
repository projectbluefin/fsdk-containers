# VM guest (bootable raw disk)

Use for the standalone EFI VM disk consumed by donate-clanker. The historical
`podman-vm/*` element names remain, but this guest is not a Podman host and is
not an OCI, QCOW2, or nspawn artifact.

## Element chain

`vm/minimal/deps.bst` → `podman-vm/podman-vm-deps.bst` →
`podman-vm/podman-vm-filesystem.bst` →
`podman-vm/podman-vm-efi.bst`

The base is FSDK's full VM/uutils userspace. The guest adds networking,
certificates, git, and the pinned donate-clanker worker. It deliberately has no
Podman, SSH, cloud-init, or `qemu-img`.

`podman-vm-efi.bst` stages the FSDK EFI tree and uses `genimage` to assemble a
raw GPT disk. Its install root contains only:

```text
donate-clanker-vm-<fsdk-version>-<arch>.raw
donate-clanker-vm-<fsdk-version>-<arch>.raw.sha256
```

The raw disk is booted directly by QEMU. `qemu-img` is not a build or runtime
dependency.

## Verification

- `BST_LOCAL=1 just bst show --deps all podman-vm/podman-vm-efi.bst`
- `just export-podman-vm` checks out the raw disk and checksum manifest.
- Confirm the worker source pin is
  `96cc69f5779d63b908d5f53957287b7ef6bda7fa`.
- Treat the observed x86_64 local benchmark (~10 minutes, 2.2G raw) as
  indicative only, not a contract.
